Security

This code uses the Express and WebSocket libraries for creating an HTTP server and WebSocket server, respectively. It also uses the OpenAI API to generate responses.

Security best practices are followed in the following ways:

The OpenAI API key is stored in a .env file and is accessed using the dotenv library, which ensures that the key is not exposed in the source code.
The code uses the latest versions of the libraries, which have security patches applied.

However, there are some potential security concerns to consider:

The code is listening on a specific host and port. Make sure that the host and port are properly configured to only accept connections from trusted sources.
The code is handling user input, it is important to validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
